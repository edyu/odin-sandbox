# Odin Sandbox

Mostly a test repository for learning [odin](https://odinlang) and showcasing how to organize an odin project.

The code is mostly from YouTube videos by [Richard Andersson](https://www.youtube.com/@mccGoNZooo).

To run the code, I'd recommend to first install [Task](https://taskfile.dev).

And then run `task b` to build and/or `task t` to test.

[Task](https://taskfile.dev) allows you to add `--watch` for continuous development.

Otherwise, you can always just do `odin run sandbox` or `odin test sandbox`.
